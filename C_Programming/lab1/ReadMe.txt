Thank you for reading this.

For question 1: normal operation should do fine. test code is in comment mode already. Comment them out to see the result.

For question 2: driver codes are in comment mode at the beginning of the file. Run it by commenting out and change the value should be okay.

For question 3: you could enter your input several times to check the result. Also, I include another version of this question. 
I don't know what's wrong with the second commented out method, so if you can help me spot any bug, I would be much appreciated!

For question 4: normal operation should do fine. Test the result by entering inputs.

For question 5: normal operation should do fine. Test the result by entering inputs.
